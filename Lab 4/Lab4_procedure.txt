For bus topology:

Executing tcl file:
> ns bus.tcl

Creating throughput data file from trace file:
> awk -f bus_throughput.awk bus.tr > bus_tgraph.dat

Creating packet loss ratio data file from trace file:
> awk -f bus_plr.awk bus.tr > bus_plrgraph.dat

Generating graphs using gnuplot
> gnuplot
>> load "bus_tgnu.plt"
>> load "bus_plrgnu.plt"



For star topology:

Executing tcl file:
> ns star.tcl

Creating throughput data file from trace file:
> awk -f star_throughput.awk star.tr > star_tgraph.dat

Creating packet loss ratio data file from trace file:
> awk -f star_plr.awk star.tr > star_plrgraph.dat

Generating graphs using gnuplot
> gnuplot
>> load "star_tgnu.plt"
>> load "star_plrgnu.plt"



For wired transmission:

Executing tcl file:
> ns wired.tcl

Creating throughput data file from trace file:
> awk -f wired_throughput.awk wired.tr > wired_tgraph.dat

Creating packet loss ratio data file from trace file:
> awk -f wired_plr.awk wired.tr > wired_plrgraph.dat

Generating graphs using gnuplot
> gnuplot
>> load "wired_tgnu.plt"
>> load "wired_plrgnu.plt"



For wireless transmission:

Executing tcl file:
> ns wireless.tcl

Creating throughput data file from trace file:
> awk -f wireless_throughput.awk wireless.tr > wireless_tgraph.dat

Creating packet loss ratio data file from trace file:
> awk -f wireless_plr.awk wireless.tr > wireless_plrgraph.dat

Generating graphs using gnuplot
> gnuplot
>> load "wireless_throughput.plt"
>> load "wireless_plr.plt"
